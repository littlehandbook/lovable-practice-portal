# Therapist-Client Portal

A comprehensive web application for therapists and clients, fully migrated to a microservices architecture. This platform provides secure authentication, user management, branding customization, and integrated video sessions through a modern React frontend.

## üéØ Project Overview

### Purpose & Scope
This project serves as a therapist-client portal that has been fully migrated from Supabase stored procedures to standalone microservices. The application enables secure communication, session management, and administrative functions while maintaining HIPAA-compliant data handling.

### Key Features
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **User & Role Management**: Multi-tenant user administration with custom roles
- **Branding Customization**: Tenant-specific logos, colors, and practice branding
- **Video Sessions**: Twilio-powered telehealth sessions with recording capabilities
- **Document Management**: Secure file upload and storage for client documents
- **Session Notes**: Comprehensive note-taking with templates and OCR support
- **Client Portal**: Self-service booking, forms, and document access

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Microservices & Vite Proxy

#### Service-First Design
Each business domain is encapsulated in its own microservice with dedicated responsibilities:

- **Auth Service**: User authentication, registration, and JWT token management
- **User Service**: User profiles, role assignments, and tenant management
- **Branding Service**: Logo uploads, color themes, and practice customization
- **Configuration Service**: Application settings and feature toggles
- **Twilio Service**: Video room creation, token generation, and webhook handling
- **Email Verification Service**: Email validation and verification workflows

#### Frontend Proxy
The React/Vite client uses a development server proxy to route API requests seamlessly:

```javascript
// vite.config.ts proxy configuration
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: process.env.MS_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
  }
}
```

This approach eliminates CORS issues during development and provides a clean separation between frontend and backend services.

#### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Microservices architecture with REST APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access control
- **Video**: Twilio Video API integration
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions with automated migrations

## üîß Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `MS_API_URL` | Base URL for microservices | `http://localhost:3001` | Yes |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `development` | No |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing/verifying tokens | - | Yes |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | - | Yes |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account identifier | - | Yes |
| `TWILIO_API_KEY` | Twilio API key for video services | - | Yes |
| `TWILIO_API_SECRET` | Twilio API secret | - | Yes |
| `EMAIL_SERVICE_URL` | Email verification service URL | - | Yes |
| `UPLOAD_BUCKET` | File storage bucket name | - | Yes |

### Setup Instructions

1. Copy the environment template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Fill in the required values in `.env`
3. Ensure all microservices are running and accessible via `MS_API_URL`

## üìö API Documentation

### OpenAPI Specification
The complete API documentation is available in machine-readable format:

- **Swagger UI**: [https://api.yourdomain.com/docs](https://api.yourdomain.com/docs)
- **Raw OpenAPI Spec**: [docs/openapi.yaml](./docs/openapi.yaml)

You can import the OpenAPI specification into tools like Postman, Insomnia, or API documentation platforms.

### Key Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description | Service |

| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user credentials | Auth |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Register new user account | Auth |
| `GET` | `/api/users/{userId}` | Retrieve user profile | User |
| `PUT` | `/api/users/{userId}` | Update user profile | User |
| `GET` | `/api/branding/{tenantId}` | Get tenant branding settings | Branding |
| `PUT` | `/api/branding/{tenantId}` | Update tenant branding | Branding |

| `POST` | `/api/email-verification/verify` | Verify email with token | Email |

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Migrations
Database schema changes are managed using Flyway migrations with automated GitHub Actions deployment.

#### Migration Naming Convention
All migration files follow the pattern: `V<version>__<description>.sql`

Examples:
- `V1__initial_schema.sql`
- `V2__add_user_roles.sql`
- `V3__drop_legacy_stored_procedures.sql`

#### Automated Deployment
Migrations run automatically when:
1. Changes are pushed to the `main` branch
2. Files in `db/migrations/` are modified

See [db/README.md](./db/README.md) for detailed migration instructions.
